There once was a story that I do nary tell . . . 
About a magical woman who was born from hell
On the old Skin-walker ranch 
Where the aliens do now dwell
The Holy Son descended himself 
Prepared to reenter the world and tell
Us all before our Great Extinction
What would await humankind near completion . . .
